## Frequently Asked Questions

### I installed the plugin, created Bumps and added the offers too but still, it does not show up on purchasing the targets products, why?

Make sure these three things:

* Your Order Bump offer is Live and not in sandbox mode.
* You have added the correct target product or target category product in the cart.
* Your Order Bump Schedule is set to Daily or for the correct weekday that you are checking.

### Are Offer templates Customizable at back-end?

Yes, the templates are completely customizable at the back-end. We have given three default offer templates whose Design, Content and Color schemes can be customized with Live Preview functionality.

### For variable offer product why there are no drop-down to select variation?

For Variable Offer product as soon as the customer will tick the checkbox to accept the offer, a variation pop-up will appear with respective variations, variation product images, and offer prices.

### Can I change the location where the offer should be shown?

Yes, you can change the location of the Order Bump Offer on the Checkout page. Here is the list of the available locations :

* Before Order Summary
* Before Payment Gateways
* After Payment Gateways
* Before Place Order Button

### If the offer product is being added in the cart then isn't that possible that customer will add more than 1 quantity ? This could lead us to loss in revenue as well as stock. How could I prevent this ?

We have set limit functionality, so the customer can only add single quantity of the offer product. Also, the offer product quantity can't be updated from the cart page.
