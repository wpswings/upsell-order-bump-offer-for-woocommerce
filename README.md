## WHAT’S INCLUDED IN OUR FREE UPSELL ORDER BUMP OFFER PLUGIN

**1)  Special Offer On the Checkout Page**
Upsell Order Bump Offer for WooCommerce provides a unique form of a well-timed offer as a checkout bump. This is a one-time exclusive offer that allows the customers to purchase things at a well-valued price.

**2) Just a precious single click to accept the offer**
The Order Bump offer can be accepted in just a single click in which the customer can just simply tick the checkbox to add the offer to their existing order.

**3) Category Based Offer Triggering**
You can trigger your WooCommerce checkout offers based on the target Category of products, For example, if anyone purchases a product from the Electronics category then your Order Bump offer will be triggered and the offer will be shown.

Setting up the target category saves a lot of time from adding individual products as targets and you can set up related upsell offers that will show up for the right category.

**4) Bump Offer Scheduling**
The Order Bumps can be scheduled for specific weekdays which can make them exclusive and available only for that set period of time.

**5) Product Specific Bump Offers**
Each of your WooCommerce Order Bumps can be designed and customized differently and specifically according to the offered product.

**6) Template Customization with Live Preview**
Merchants can customize order bump offers and view Live Preview at the same time. Live Preview is available for Template, Design, and Content. Live Preview Customization helps in creating appealing Order Bumps for your WooCommerce store.

**10) Behavioral Reporting**

Merchants can analyze the customer behavior for every individual bump offer.

It also shows the conversion rate as well as the total sales for every order bump offer.

**11) Sales Report**

With the Order Bump Sales Report, a merchant can track the sale of the products that were sold as a bump offer. It lets you track the sale of those products for a specific time period and also enables you to track the sales as per individual products and product categories.

The plugin comes with full compatibility with simple, variable, and subscription product types. This increases the range of product offerings that you can provide to your customers.

**13) Enable Permalink On Product Title And Image**
By enabling the permalink option from the Global Settings your customers can view the bump offer product in detail. Customers can click either on the product title or the product image of the bump offer product on the checkout page. As a result, the customer will be redirected to a new page where they can view the complete information.
