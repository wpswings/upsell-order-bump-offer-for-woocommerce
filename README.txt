== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the difference between Order Bump and Upsell in eCommerce? = 
In eCommerce, both [**Order Bumps and Upsells**](https://wpswings.com/blog/order-bump-vs-upsell/?utm_source=order-bump-org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=blog) are clever ways to increase your sales, but they go about it in different ways:

- Order Bump: Think of an order bump as a quick and easy offer that pops up during checkout. It’s something small and complementary to what the customer has already added to their cart, like an extra accessory or a simple upgrade. It’s usually presented as a checkbox that customers can tick without much thought, making it a seamless add-on.

- Upsell: An upsell is a little more intentional. It's about offering your customer a higher-priced version of the product they've already chosen, or perhaps a completely different product that adds more value. This is usually presented after they've made their initial purchase decision, either in a follow-up pop-up or on a new page after checkout.

= What is frequently bought together? = 
Frequently Bought Together typically refers to a carefully selected group of products aimed at increasing revenue for a woocommerce store. This feature is commonly used for upselling or cross-selling items, rather than simply showcasing products that are frequently purchased together.

= What Is Cross Sell? = 
Cross-selling involves promoting related products or services that can fulfill additional needs of the customer. Here is a Woocommerce cross sell example, if a customer buys a smartphone, a retailer might suggest accessories like a case or screen protector. In financial services, a bank might cross-sell a personal loan to a customer who already has a mortgage.

= How to add related products in WooCommerce? = 
To add related products to WooCommerce, you can utilize the built-in feature in woocommerce:- 

1. Access the Product Page
Navigate to your WordPress dashboard.
Go to Products > All Products and select the product you want to edit.

2. Add Related Products
Scroll down to the Product Data section and click on the Linked Products tab.
> Here, you can add:
– Up-Sells: Products that are more expensive or of higher quality than the current product.
– Cross-Sells: Complementary products that customers might want to buy along with the current product.

= What Is A Bump Offer? = 
A bump offer, also known as an order bump, is an additional product or service presented to customers during the checkout process of an online purchase. It typically appears as a checkbox alongside the main product, allowing customers to easily add complementary items to their order just before completing their payment. This strategy is designed to increase the average order value by encouraging impulse buys of lower-cost items that enhance the primary purchase.

= Can I add more templates as per my website design? =
Yes, you can add more than one template with different designs and colors. In the free version, we have provided two free templates and in the premium version more than 8+ templates have been added, and more are coming soon.

= How to show the Bump offer on using the CheckoutWC 's Checkout? =
> After activating the CheckoutWC plugin, then go to our Global settings and 
> Go to "Offer Location", set any setting (Prefer "Before Payment Gateway" or "After Payment Gateway ") and then save once.
> Now, you can use the  Order Bump with the CheckoutWC plugin.

= Is the order bump compatible with all themes? =
That’s a query that helps us to make it much better now. Although it appears impossible, we have managed to make it compatible with all of the available themes. We have tested our plugin with a large number of themes, and several customers have reported success. In any case, if your theme is incompatible, we would be grateful if you could inform our team so that we could check the compatibility.

6) Make the funnel Live and save changes.

= My Order Bump Offer not showing? =

= Can I show more than one order bump on one page? =
Yes, in the premium version of WooCommerce order bump, you can show more than one bump at a time. To set that go to Global settings and set the number of bumps you want to show like 2,3 or more.

There you’ll find a feature named “Skip for Same Offers.” Click on the dropdown in front of it and select Yes and save changes.

= What happens to the bump offer product if the customer removes the target product from the cart? =
