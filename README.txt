== WHAT’S INCLUDED IN OUR FREE WOOCOMMERCE ORDER BUMP PLUGIN ==

**1) Special Offer On the Checkout Page**
The WooCommerce order bump plugin provides a unique form of a well-timed offer as a checkout upsell bump. This can also be a one-time exclusive offer that allows the customers to purchase things at a well-valued price.

**2) Just a Precious Single Click to Accept the Offer**
The Order Bump offer can be accepted in just a single click in which the customer can just simply tick the checkbox to add the offer to their existing order.

**3) Category-Based Offer Triggering**
You can trigger your WooCommerce checkout upsell offers based on the target category of products. For example, if anyone purchases a product from the Electronics category then your Order Bump offer will be triggered and the offer will be shown.

Setting up the target category saves a lot of time from adding individual products as targets and you can set up related upsell WooCommerce offers that will show up for the right category.

**4) Bump Offer Scheduling**
The Order Bumps can be scheduled for specific weekdays which can make them exclusive and available only for that set period of time.

**5) Product-Specific Bump Offers**
Each of your WooCommerce Order Bumps can be designed and customized differently and specifically according to the offered product.

**6) Template Customization with Live Preview**
Merchants can customize order bump offers and view Live Preview at the same time. Live Preview is available for Template, Design, and Content. Live Preview Customization helps in creating appealing Order Bumps for your WooCommerce store.

**7) Multiple Locations on the Checkout page**
The additional offers can be displayed in multiple locations on the Checkout Page. You can display them as “Before Order Summary”, “Before Payment Gateways”, “After Payment Gateways”, and “Before Place Order Button”.

**8) Choose the Background Color of the Bump Offer Box**
Customize the background color of the bump offer box as per your liking using the background color feature. Make the offer as attractive as you can by choosing the righteous color combinations and elevate your AOV

**9) Sandbox Mode**
Our WooCommerce Order Bump plugin has Sandbox mode that gives you the ability to Live Preview and Customize the Order Bump Offer layout and modify every element before making it Live.

**10) Responsive Order Bumps Design**
The WooCommerce upsell bump offers are completely responsive for every type of device no matter whether it is Desktop, Mobile, or Tablet.

**11) Behavioral Reporting**
Merchants can analyze the customer behavior for every individual bump offer. With this behavioral report, a merchant can check the number of times a particular offer was viewed, accepted, or removed from the cart. It also shows the conversion rate and the total sales for every order bump offer.

**12) Sales Report**
With the Order Bump Sales Report, a merchant can track the sale of the products that were sold as a bump offer. It lets you track the sale of those products for a specific time period and also enables you to track the sales as per individual products and product categories.

**13) Major Product Types Support**
The WooCommerce Order Bump plugin comes with full compatibility with simple, variable, and subscription product types. This increases the range of product offerings that you can provide to your customers.

**14) Enable Permalink On Product Title And Image**
By enabling the permalink option from the Global Settings your customers can view the bump offer product in detail. Customers can click either on the product title or the product image of the bump offer product on the checkout page. As a result, the customer will be redirected to a new page to view the complete information.

**15) Add a Custom Image**
This is one of our recent features. The admin can change the default bump offer product image from the funnel setting and replace it with a custom image.
