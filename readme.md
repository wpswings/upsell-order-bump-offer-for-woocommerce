Upsell Order Bump Offer for WooCommerce provides a unique form of a well-timed offer as a checkout bump. This is a one-time exclusive offer that allows the customers to purchase things at a well-valued price.

The Order Bump offer can be accepted in just a single click in which the customer can just simply tick the checkbox to add the offer to their existing order.

You can trigger your WooCommerce checkout offers based on the target Category of products, For example, if anyone purchases a product from the Electronics category then your Order Bump offer will be triggered and the offer will be shown.

Setting up the target category saves a lot of time from adding individual products as targets and you can set up related upsell offers that will show up for the right category.

**4) Bump Offer Scheduling**
The Order Bumps can be scheduled for specific weekdays which can make them exclusive and available only for that set period of time.

Each of your WooCommerce Order Bumps can be designed and customized differently and specifically according to the offer product.

Merchants can customize order bump offers and view Live Preview at the same time. Live Preview is available for Template, Design, and Content. Live Preview Customization helps in creating appealing Order Bumps for your WooCommerce store.

**11) Sales Report**

With the Order Bump Sales Report, a merchant can track the sale of the products that were sold as a bump offer. It lets you track the sale of those products for a specific time period and also enables you to track the sales as per individual products and product categories.
