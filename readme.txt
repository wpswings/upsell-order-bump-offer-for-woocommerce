= What page builders does this plugin support? = 
Most of the major WordPress page builders like Elementor, WPBakery, Divibuilders, Thrive Architect, and other WordPress page builders are supported for creating attractive upsell offers. 

= What is the difference between Order Bump and Upsell in eCommerce? = 
In eCommerce, both [**Order Bumps and Upsells**](https://wpswings.com/blog/order-bump-vs-upsell/?utm_source=order-bump-org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=blog) are clever ways to increase your sales, but they go about it in different ways:

– Order Bump: Think of an order bump as a quick and easy offer that pops up during checkout. It’s something small and complementary to what the customer has already added to their cart, like an extra accessory or a simple upgrade. It’s usually presented as a checkbox that customers can tick without much thought, making it a seamless add-on.

– Upsell: An upsell is a little more intentional. It's about offering your customer a higher-priced version of the product they've already chosen, or perhaps a completely different product that adds more value. This is usually presented after they've made their initial purchase decision, either in a follow-up pop-up or on a new page after checkout.

= What is frequently bought together? = 
Frequently Bought Together typically refers to a carefully selected group of products aimed at increasing revenue for a woocommerce store. This feature is commonly used for upselling or cross-selling items, rather than simply showcasing products that are frequently purchased together.

= What Is Cross Sell? = 
Cross-selling involves promoting related products or services that can fulfill additional needs of the customer. Here is a Woocommerce cross sell example, if a customer buys a smartphone, a retailer might suggest accessories like a case or screen protector. In financial services, a bank might cross-sell a personal loan to a customer who already has a mortgage.

= How to add related products in WooCommerce? = 
To add related products to WooCommerce, you can utilize the built-in feature in woocommerce:- 

1. Access the Product Page
Navigate to your WordPress dashboard.
Go to Products > All Products and select the product you want to edit.

2. Add Related Products
Scroll down to the Product Data section and click on the Linked Products tab.
> Here, you can add:
– Up-Sells: Products that are more expensive or of higher quality than the current product.
– Cross-Sells: Complementary products that customers might want to buy along with the current product.

= What Is A Bump Offer? = 
A bump offer, also known as an order bump, is an additional product or service presented to customers during the checkout process of an online purchase. It typically appears as a checkbox alongside the main product, allowing customers to easily add complementary items to their order just before completing their payment. This strategy is designed to increase the average order value by encouraging impulse buys of lower-cost items that enhance the primary purchase.

= Can I add more templates as per my website design? =
Yes, you can add more than one template with different designs and colors. In the free version, we have provided two free templates and in the premium version more than 8+ templates have been added, and more are coming soon.

= What is Offer Appearance? =
In the offer appearance of order bump you can show offers in two types, one is simple to offer in a static format and the other is in the form of a pop-up. Whatever suits your users you can use as per need. This Simple Offer feature is only available in the premium version of the plugin

In this case, you get two options. Either remove or keep the offered product in the customer's cart. To do this, you need to go to the Order Bump Upsell plugin’s 'Global Settings' > 'Offer Target Dependency' feature, you’ll see two options here:

“Remove offer when target product is removed” – As the Target product is removed the offer product associated with the target will also be removed from your customer's cart.

“Keep offer when target product is removed” – As the Target product is removed the offer product associated with the target will be converted into a normal product in your customer's cart.

= Can I offer subscription products as Order bumps? =
Yes, our plugin supports Simple, Variable, and Subscription products.

= Can I track the performance of my Order Bumps? =
Yes, we have Order Bump – Behavioral Analytics that shows Individual Order Bump Performance metrics such as View Count, Success Count, Offer to Accept Count, Offer to Remove Count, Conversion Rate, and Total Sales. With the help of these metrics, you can easily figure out how your Order Bumps are performing and make changes accordingly.

= I installed an upsell plugin, created funnels, and added the offers too but still, it does not show up on purchasing the funnel targets. = 
If the upsell offers are not showing, make sure the:
1) You’ve enabled the One-Click Upsell funnel plugin. Navigate to Global Settings and enable the plugin if it is disabled.
2) Your funnel is not in Sandbox Mode. If it is, edit the funnel and make it Live, and Save Changes.
3) You are testing for the correct target product or category you’ve set in the funnel builder.
4) The offer page is published.
5) You’re making the payment through one of our supported payment gateways. The offer will not be displayed if you make payments through a payment gateway not supported by our plugin.
6) Make sure you have selected any one of the following sales funnel templates or made your own custom template and inserted a page link.
