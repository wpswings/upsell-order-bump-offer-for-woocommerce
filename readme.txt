=== Why Choose Our WooCommerce Upsell Plugin? ===

Unlock exclusive upgrades and choose to boost your sales at checkout with our WooCommerce upsell and order bump plugin, the perfect solution for seamless offers and cross-sells. 


== ⭐ Salient Features Of Upsell Funnel Builder  ==

#### 1) Shortcodes To Build Useful Offer Page Elements

This WordPress upsell plugin provides various shortcodes to create different offer page elements. The plugin offers shortcodes for Buy Now, No Thanks, Product Title, Description, Short Description, Image, Price, Variations, Offer Quantity, and Urgency Timer. The admins can incorporate bump offers across the website as per their requirements, using this [wps_bump_offer_shortcode] shortcode. This increases the accessibility of the bump offers, further increasing the overall user experience.

#### 2) Set Custom Order Success Page

Take customization and personalization to a whole new level. The admin can now customize and make their very own order success page. You can do this by creating a page.

#### 3. Special Bump Offer On The Checkout Page

The Upsell Funnel Builder plugin provides a unique form of a well-timed offer, such as a checkout bump. This can also be a one-time exclusive offer allowing customers to purchase things at a well-valued price.

#### 4) Popup Maker

You have the option to display an eCommerce sales pop-up featuring the order bump product image or title on the checkout page using the upsell pop-up feature. A radio button allows you to enable or disable the pop-up display. Additionally, the exit-intent pop-up feature triggers a pop-up when a customer attempts to leave the browser, making it a powerful upselling hack for your business.

#### 5) Category-Based Offer Triggering

Using the Plugin, you can trigger your checkout offers based on the target category of products. Setting up the target category saves a lot of time from adding individual products as targets and you can set up related offers that will show up for the right category.

#### 6) Smart Post-Purchase Upsell Offer Scheduling

Utilize the smart offer feature, and schedule order bumps for specific weekdays which can make them exclusive and available only for that set time.

#### 7) Related Product-Specific Cross-Sell Offers

Each of your Order Bumps can be designed and customized differently and specifically according to the offered product.

#### 8) Upsell Template Customization With Sandbox Mode

Merchants can customize order bump offers and view Live Preview at the same time. Live Preview is available for Template, Design, and Content. Live Preview Customization helps in creating appealing offers for your WooCommerce store.

#### 9) Multiple Locations On The WooCommerce Upsell Checkout Page

The additional upsell offers can be displayed in multiple locations on the WooCommerce after the Checkout Page. You can display them as “Before Order Summary”, “Before Payment Gateways”, “After Payment Gateways”, and “Before Place Order Button”.

#### 10) Choose The Background Color Of The Bump Offer Box

Customize the background color of the WooCommerce bump offer box as per your liking using the background color feature. Make the offer as attractive as you can by choosing the righteous color combinations and elevate your AOV.

#### 11) Responsive Order Bumps Design

The offers are completely responsive for every type of device no matter whether it is a Desktop, Mobile, or Tablet.

#### 12) Behavioral Reporting

Merchants can analyze the customer behavior for every individual offer. With this behavioral report, a merchant can check the number of times a particular offer was viewed, accepted, or removed from the cart.

#### 13) Sales Report

With the Sales Report, a merchant can track the sale of the products that were sold as a bump offer. It lets you track the sale of those products for a specific time and also enables you to track the sales as per individual products and product categories.

#### 14) Enable Permalink On Product Title And Image

By enabling the permalink option from the Global Settings your customers can view the bump offer product in detail. Customers can click either on the product title or the product image of the WooCommerce bump offer product on the checkout page.

#### 15) Add a Custom Image

The admin can change the default order bump offer product image from the funnel setting and replace it with a custom image.

#### 16) Variable Products & Category Support

The WooCommerce Upsell plugin allows you to create multiple one-time upsell offers specifically for variable products and on categories, giving you the flexibility to offer different variations and upsell on categories.

#### 17) Free Order Upsell

The Upsell funnel has the option to trigger the upsell funnel on a zero cart amount, after enabling this setting upsell will be triggered even if the checkout value is zero.

#### 18) Unlimited Funnels with an Unlimited Number of Offers

You can create unlimited sales funnels with any number of Upsell and Cross Sell Offers. Show your customers multiple post-purchase or aftersale offers in a single sales funnel which increases the impulse buys, average order value, and revenue of your store.

#### 19) Add the Shipping Price On COD One Click Upsells

Our free click funnel plugin allows you to set the shipping price for the cash-on-delivery payment method for upsell offers. This allows you to cover operational costs for delivering the COD upsell products and maintain your profits.

#### 20) Global Funnels

Create global one-click funnels that trigger independently without needing target products. Utilize the universal WooCommerce one-click upsell to show offers to your customers every time they purchase in your online store.

#### 21) Exclusive Offer Feature

The upsell sales funnel builder creates exclusive offers for the customers, which will be shown to customers only once based on the order email. Such one-click upsell offers garner higher conversion rates.

#### 22) Page Builder Support to Build Responsive Upsell Offers

Build the one-click upsell funnel for WooCommerce with Elementor Page Builder and other top builders available on WordPress. Our plugin allows you to easily create and customize your upsell offer pages without coding knowledge.

Free Version: Simple Products and Variable Products

= Can I track the performance of my Upsell Funnels? =

= What page builders does this plugin support? = 
Most of the major WordPress page builders like Elementor, WPBakery, Divibuilders, Thrive Architect, and other WordPress page builders are supported for creating attractive upsell offers. 

= What is the difference between Order Bump and Upsell in eCommerce? = 
In eCommerce, both [**Order Bumps and Upsells**](https://wpswings.com/blog/order-bump-vs-upsell/?utm_source=order-bump-org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=blog) are clever ways to increase your sales, but they go about it in different ways:

– Order Bump: Think of an order bump as a quick and easy offer that pops up during checkout. It’s something small and complementary to what the customer has already added to their cart, like an extra accessory or a simple upgrade. It’s usually presented as a checkbox that customers can tick without much thought, making it a seamless add-on.

– Upsell: An upsell is a little more intentional. It's about offering your customer a higher-priced version of the product they've already chosen, or perhaps a completely different product that adds more value. This is usually presented after they've made their initial purchase decision, either in a follow-up pop-up or on a new page after checkout.

= What is frequently bought together? = 
Frequently Bought Together typically refers to a carefully selected group of products aimed at increasing revenue for a woocommerce store. This feature is commonly used for upselling or cross-selling items, rather than simply showcasing products that are frequently purchased together.

= What Is Cross Sell? = 
Cross-selling involves promoting related products or services that can fulfill additional needs of the customer. Here is a Woocommerce cross sell example, if a customer buys a smartphone, a retailer might suggest accessories like a case or screen protector. In financial services, a bank might cross-sell a personal loan to a customer who already has a mortgage.

= How to add related products in WooCommerce? = 
To add related products to WooCommerce, you can utilize the built-in feature in woocommerce:- 

1. Access the Product Page
Navigate to your WordPress dashboard.
Go to Products > All Products and select the product you want to edit.

2. Add Related Products
Scroll down to the Product Data section and click on the Linked Products tab.
> Here, you can add:
– Up-Sells: Products that are more expensive or of higher quality than the current product.
– Cross-Sells: Complementary products that customers might want to buy along with the current product.

= What Is A Bump Offer? = 
A bump offer, also known as an order bump, is an additional product or service presented to customers during the checkout process of an online purchase. It typically appears as a checkbox alongside the main product, allowing customers to easily add complementary items to their order just before completing their payment. This strategy is designed to increase the average order value by encouraging impulse buys of lower-cost items that enhance the primary purchase.

= Can I add more templates as per my website design? =
Yes, you can add more than one template with different designs and colors. In the free version, we have provided two free templates and in the premium version more than 8+ templates have been added, and more are coming soon.

= What is Offer Appearance? =
In the offer appearance of order bump you can show offers in two types, one is simple to offer in a static format and the other is in the form of a pop-up. Whatever suits your users you can use as per need. This Simple Offer feature is only available in the premium version of the plugin

= How to show the Bump offer on using the CheckoutWC 's Checkout? =
> After activating the CheckoutWC plugin, then go to our Global settings and 
> Go to "Offer Location", set any setting (Prefer "Before Payment Gateway" or "After Payment Gateway ") and then save once.
